# WinPushBullet
WinPushBullet is a set of hot keys and File Explorer context menu options which allow you to quickly push and pull content to/from your PushBullet account.
PushBullet is a service that allows you to share files between your different devices.

I use WinPushBullet to quickly share files between my Windows PC and my Apple devices, achieving AirDrop like functionality.
